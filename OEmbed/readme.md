# OEmbed Support

## License

This ElkArte add-on is released under the terms of the WTFPL. Take it and do with it what the fuck you want.

Parts of this add-on (mostly, the idea and the regular expressions) were ported from my [blog software](https://www.blogcpp.org) which is also licensed under the same terms.

## Features

Makes ElkArte support OEmbed, duh. Note that additional CSS is not a part of this add-on, but (e.g.) YouTube provides their own embedded stylesheets.

## Requirements

This add-on won't do anything unless your PHP installation has the `curl` extension enabled. By default, only JSON OEmbeds are recognized. If the `xml` extension is available, XML OEmbeds will be respected as well.

## Donations

In case you absolutely want to make me richer, you can donate some money: [PayPal](https://paypal.me/GebtmireuerGeld).
